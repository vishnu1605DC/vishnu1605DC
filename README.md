## **Profile Summary** 📝

Driven and detail-oriented Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student specializing in VLSI design and verification. Trained under a seasoned Microsoft Verification Engineer, I possess hands-on experience in Verilog, System Verilog, and UVM. Adept at digital electronics, network analysis, and transistor technologies (BJT, FET, CMOS). I excel in front-end VLSI, coding in C and Java, with a strong grasp of OOP concepts and programming fundamentals.

Experienced working in professional VLSI verification environments including Cygwin terminal, GVim editor, and QuestaSim simulator. Proficient in executing simulations via .do files, basic scripting for automation (.sh files), and command-line workflow. My VLSI journey is marked by complex project work—ranging from FIFO and RAM designs to verification IP and protocol-based architectures. Currently, I am developing and verifying a DMA Controller within the XCHIP Cohort SMP. I am enthusiastic about staying updated with the latest technology trends, CPUs, GPUs, and automotive engineering.
